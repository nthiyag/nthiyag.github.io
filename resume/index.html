                <p>
                <strong>Welcome to my personal portfolio! This website is <strong class="text-primary">custom made</strong> using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                Welcome to my web resume! My name is Nikhil and I'm an Engineering Science (Aerospace) student at UofT with a particular passion for the intersection of robotics and aerospace. I am in my final year of undergraduate studies, and have past experience working in formal robotics lab settings, as well as experience working in the Canadian space industry. I have contributed to real and anaologue space missions, primarily to the BEACON mission which will explore the lunar south pole with a small CubeRover. My research interests are in enabling long-duration autonomy in unstructured environments. Robotics and aerospace have been long-term passions of mine, stemming from a childhood love of space exploration, and I'd love to continue getting experience working in those domains.  <br><br>
                    
                This site is intended to serve as a supplement to my resume. It contains information that I didn't have enough space to fit in my resume, but that I still feel is worth talking about somwehere. Feel free to add me on LinkedIn, and take a look at my GitHub for examples of the public code I've written in the past!

            <ul class="exp-list">
                <li>During COVID, attempted to design a functional Stirling Engine as a physics project</li>
                <li>Determined physical constraints, and developed a mathematical model to aid in choosing physical parameters</li>
                <li>Used Solidworks to CAD the engine, then ordered parts and constructed it</li>
                <li>Unfortunately, the engine ran into frictional issues that could not be easily overcome without additional spending on parts</li>
                <li>All of this was done for a physics class, and I documented every step, available <a href="https://nthiyag.github.io/stirling-engine/">here</a></li>

                <li><i>Motivation</i> <br>
                    <ul class="exp-sublist">
                        <li>It had been a longtime personal goal of mine to implement Pure Pursuit type path following algorithms for autonomous control of VRC robots (see <a href="#Design-Team-Exp">VRC</a>)</li>
                        <li>During Covid lockdowns, I was unable to test these algorithms on a physical VEX robot</li>
                        <li>Instead, I decided to simulate them virtually so that I could implement them on a physical robot later (unfortunately I graduated before lockdowns were lifted)</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Developed a Python based simulator using a Tkinter frontend to simulate the first order dynamics of a holonomic drivetrain (using high school physics concepts)</li>
                <li>Implemented a path planner and Pure Pursuit controller on this virtual drivetrain, assuming perfect odometry input</li>
                <li>Given an initial and target robot pose, the algorithm first interpolates between them using a Hermite spline (a cubic), then samples a number of discrete waypoints along the spline</li>
                <li>At each step, the drivetrain follows a simple proportional control loop targeting one of these waypoints - once it gets close enough, it switches the target to the next waypoint along the spline</li>
                <li>This process repeats, while angular error is handled by a separate proportional control loop (can be decoupled since the system is holonomic)</li>

                <li><i>Motivation</i> <br>
                    <ul class="exp-sublist">
                        <li>When assembling mechanisms for VRC (see <a href="#Design-Team-Exp">VRC</a>), improper spacing in the assembly of VEX COTS parts can lead to flimsiness or a drop in performance (usually due to friction)</li>
                        <li>This is normally aleviated by using CAD software (ie. Solidworks) to plan out the relative spacing of each part, but that is unwieldy when rapidly prototyping to test design ideas</li>
                        <li>This leads to prototypes being flimsy/inefficient, which provides a skewed understanding of design ideas</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Developed a Tkinter based application in Python to aid in rapidly calculating the optimal spacing between VEX COTS parts</li>
                <li>This part spacing tool allows users to virtually test out combinations of COTS spacing elements between standard VEX parts - this is much faster than full blown CAD, and requires no physical guesswork</li>

                    <ul class="exp-sublist">
                        <li>EngSci students are required to take a certain number of Humanities & Social Science (HSS) courses throughout our degree - most students take one in their 4th semester</li>
                        <li>These courses are usually offered by a different faculty, so scheduling with EngSci 2nd year timetables was a challenge at the time - there were 700+ valid HSS courses, but most were not running in 4th semester or were incompatible with our schedules</li>
                        <li>There was no existing tool provided by the university to filter HSS courses by compatibility with personal timetables - so I made my own</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Created a web-scraping tool using Selenium (in Python) to iterate through a list of valid HSS courses and query UofT's course info website for scheduling info on each one</li>
                <li>Results were compiled into a JSON containing only courses that were running in 4th semester</li>
                <li>Wrote another Python program to take in an individual's timetable as a CSV, and filter it against the JSON to provide a list of courses with no scheduling conflicts</li>
                <li>For my schedule, this process narrowed down my list of possible courses from 742 to 29</li>
                <li>Distributed the JSON and filtering program to my peers</li>
                <li>Unfortunately, within a few days UofT made their course info website inaccessible to Selenium bots, possibly as a result of my script's abuse - as a result this script is no longer functional</li>

                <li>Created a Google Sheets + Query Language spreadsheet to manage my schoolwork throughout the term - for the past couple of years, I have used this in place of a personal calendar and to-do list</li>
                <li>At the start of each term, I manually populate the spreadsheet with assignment due dates and mark breakdowns</li>
                <li>The sheet uses the Google Visualization API Query Language to generate a continuously updating to-do list of items due in the coming days</li>
                <li>This to-do list is organized so that the earliest due tasks appear first, with their colour indicating their importance (mark-distribution wise)</li>
                <li>As tasks are completed, they can be marked off of the sheet, which removes them from the to-do list</li>
                <li>When marks are released for assignments, they can be added to the sheet to compute per-course marks to-date and projected marks</li>
                <li>Distributed this sheet to my peers, some of whom still use it on a daily basis</li>
